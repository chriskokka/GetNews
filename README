GetNews


This is a simple news feed reader that lets you choose your favourite news feed,
name it and displays the the freshest 10 posts from that feed, with the option
of displaying the rest of the posts from the same feed on a separate page. All the feeds
that a user adds are saved in the h2 in-memory database that Play provides and 
the content of these feeds is displayed on the /userpage.
 
All the feed data is stored using Apache Solr. 
I am not going to add the whole Solr server here, but I am going to add the schema.xml,
since it is the only file that you need to change for this project in the standard solr
example project folder.

I am also using the Java rome library in this project, which has a dependency on jdom 1.0
(Important note: rome will not work with newer versions of jdom. At least it did not for me.) 
For the Play Framework to recognise them you have to add them to your project directory
in a folder named: lib  .(This is the easiest way)

For parsing the Solr query result I used SAXParser.
